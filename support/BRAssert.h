 * do anything.
 *
 * Invocation of the handler implies that Core has failed.  The appropriate response is to
 * delete/release all Core resources (Bitcoin/Ethereum Wallets/Transfer) and to restart Core w/
 * a FULL-SYNC for all blockchains.
 *
 * BRAssert uses the provided `signal`; generally you'd want this to be SIGUSR1/2 and not used
 * elsewhere in your code base.  (TBD truth)
